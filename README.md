Wall Street is a virtual stock trading web application made using React

The v1 of this project was made when I just started out learning React, so it has lots of bugs and some core features didn't work properly(blame decimal alegbra in JavaScript)

To improveon all of it, I have made a v2 which is just more stable and better and with good practices. I have used TypeScript in React for the first time and really liked it, having static checking goes a long way in development process.

To run the project use

```
cd v2/
yarn install
yarn start
```

Its still a WIP.
